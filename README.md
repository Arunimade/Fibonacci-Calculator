Welcome to the Fibonacci Calculator project! This simple web-based calculator allows users to compute the Fibonacci sequence using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, typically starting with 0 and 1. This project is a great introduction to basic web development concepts and understanding how algorithms work in a real-world scenario.
Introduction
The Fibonacci Calculator is designed to help users quickly compute the Fibonacci number for a given position in the sequence. The web application takes a numeric input from the user and displays the corresponding Fibonacci number. This project is implemented using basic web technologies: HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for logic.

Features
Simple and user-friendly interface.
Takes a numeric input and calculates the Fibonacci number at that position.

Real-time calculation and display of the result.
Basic validation to ensure the input is a valid positive integer.

Technologies Used
HTML: To create the structure of the web page.
CSS: To style the web page and make it visually appealing.
JavaScript: To handle the logic for calculating Fibonacci numbers and manage user interactions.
